          <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>My data focuses on which limited liability company has the most housing units in Hartford, Connecticut. Before you dive in, this project is focused on helping our community partners, Center for Leadership and Justice, that is established in Connecticut. Their goal is focused around the #NoMoreSlumlords campaign. A housing policy was passed, making LLC owners come forward and not have anymore loop holes for poor housing conditions. This data is to show the viewer which companies own the most living units in Hartford, and where their mailing addresses are located. The data does not show the location of these apartments, the data only shows the mailing address of the owners. This data will help CLJ and their campaign because it shows them where the mailing addresses are, and how many apartment units (4 and up) these companies own. This data also gives awareness to the community of the Hartford area about LLCs and how quickly they can increase and take ownership of these apartments and treat the housing conditions poorly. The data will show the viewer the impacts of LLCs.</p>
          <H2> Defining Limited Liability Companies </H2>
          <p>A Limited Liability Company, often known as LLC, is a business structure that is allowed by state statute. They are a private company that forms under a business structure in the United States that protects the owners from personal responsibility for its debts or liabilitiesOwners of an LLC are called members, and since most states do not restrict ownership, these members can include either individuals, corporations, and other entities. There is no limitation to the number of people for one member. Most states also permit “single-member” LLCs, meaning companies with a single owner.</p>
<p>My focus on this project was on owners of apartment units with 4 or more units whose mailing addresses were in Hartford. Some interesting findings during this research was the amount of LLCs owners whose mailing addresses were in downtown Hartford. There could be a possibility that multiple LLCs share the same owner. The LLC that owns the most units in Hartford is 315 Trumbull Street Association LLC with 393 units. The bottom 41% of these LLC companies own under 200 units, as the top 12% own nearly 400 units.</p>



          <H2> Figure 1 </H2><iframe width="677" height="395" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ4e4XzVV1I0aEQdAH1M8uhnwDvRJQOTSWDbjhNfNPJQIhjtcpm8aqB_MjBkxfM4lx8Bs4kZhnNnbEq/pubchart?oid=83389203&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
          <p>In the chart, figure 1, it shows the viewer a brief visualization of the impact LLC’s have on Hartford. Most of Hartford’s living units are owned by an LLC. These companies are not forced to follow housing policies, and can implement any condition they please. Most of these units are in low-income neighborhoods in Hartford. The top of the list in the chart is 315 Trumbull Street Association LLC, and the smallest LLC being Summit Trinity Hill SNF LLC. The chart shows a range of units being owned with some barely over 100 units owned to some nearly owning about 400 units in Hartford.</p> 
          <H2>Figure 2</H2> <iframe title="Housing units in Hartford owned by LLC's" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-JDG40" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JDG40/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="766"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

<p>This interactive map, figure 2 shows the location of these LLC's in Hartford. The colors on the map represent different LLC's, and the size represents the number of units they own. As you glide over the map, you can see which owners are where and how many units they own. For example, if you float over the red large circle, it will say 674 units owned, the reason for this is because some LLC's share the same mailing address, or one owner has many LLC's under one address, so I put all of the shared addresses into one circle. The other circles are solo LLC's, and are all over the Hartford area. This map allows the community of Hartford and the viewer to see where these LLC's are and how they are impacting living conditions for people in these communities.</p>
